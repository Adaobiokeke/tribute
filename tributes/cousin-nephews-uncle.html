      <h2>
        EULOGY FOR BROTHER JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI, OUR DEAR BELOVED BROTHER!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dear James Aniesodo Otiji, you who were the light of so many of our
        lives are being remembered on this solemn occasion as we feel your
        untimely loss.
        <br />
        I, and others in the Otiji family believe that your person, your
        so-human person, is no longer with us.
        <br />
        You who have always been there for the Otiji family far and wide, those
        of us who need help, advice, shoulders to cry on, hands to hold, ears to
        whisper our anguish to, and face to smile to and get a warm reception
        of, you will be all right my beloved.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this regard, I would be remiss if I did not mention that no amount of
        fancy writing words would convey the adequate honor you deserve.
        <br />
        It is never an easy task to grasp the inert, the depth of a great person
        in writing or in a speech. Words frequently fall short of capturing the
        true essence of a great one like you, Brother James.
        <br />
        My being about 7,000 miles away in the USA makes substantial emotions of
        my writing faint despite our over 60 years of relationship as blood
        brothers, friends, confidants, and fraternities.
        <br />
        In this instance, crying is almost infantile, and hopeless at best,
        because you can never come back to the family in body, but maybe in
        spirit.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I look into the abyss I can only fantasize about your silhouette, yet
        it is only a mirage in the figment of my imagination.
        <br />
        I visualize the faces of the Otiji members, and I can only see both
        smiles and tears. The tears, although there have been many tears of
        sadness since we lost you.
        <br />
        Those are not all tears of sadness, as we remember the good old times.
        The tears are the tears of joy, intermingled with nostalgic smiles, and
        good emotions, for the way you Brother James Otiji have left a permanent
        mark on our minds, hearts, and souls.
        <br />
        I can see in my mind's eyes; that each member of the family remembers
        some good encounters they had with you in your lifetime.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brother James, I can remember your childhood friends such as Michael
        Ozoalor, Mr. Nwachukwu, and Clement Aguweshi, whom I ran into at my
        school, the University of Perugia, in Perugia, Italy.
        <br />
        The first thing he said to me was how is your brother James doing,
        despite that I have not seen you for over ten years. Those of your
        friends all over the world would have their own private memories of you
        as a kind, fun-loving, and gentle soul.
        <br />
        You are a humble person who when you completed your engineering
        education in the USA, gathered your languages, and returned to Nigeria
        to work to help to improve Nigeria. The inert love in you has no
        boundary, nor limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        My brother James A. Otiji, me, and the Otiji family have the most
        treasured memories of you, your love, empathy, sympathy, and sense of
        unflinching dedication to ensuring unity in our family.
        <br />
        I do know that somewhere, in the vastness of whatever lies beyond,
        Brother James A. Otiji you are smiling down at us and wishing us well.
        <br />
        I, and all of the Otiji family love you. Brother James Otiji, go well,
        rest in peace with the Lord's blessings until we meet again in heaven.
        <br />

      <h2>
        
        TRIBUTE TO MY CHERISHED BROTHER-IN-LAW ENGR. J. A. OTIJI
      </h2>
      <p>
        
        With great shock and a very heavy heart, I received the news of your passing, and at that instant, I realised we have lost a great man in our family. 
        <br/>
        Ezeamanaogechi as you were fondly called, you were a:
        <br/>
        - Bridge builder
        <br/>
        
        - Man of your word
        <br/>
        
        - God fearing
        <br/>
        
        - Peaceful
        <br/>
        
        - Charitable
        <br/>
        
        - Wise
        <br/>
        
- Strong
<br/>

- Uncompromising
<br/>

- Hospitable and above all,
<br/>

- Honest 
<br/>

I remember years ago when I stayed with you while I concluded our house project, your hospitality and concern were impeccable. 
<br/>

We got along so well that you began to address me by "NNENNA NWUYEM” a name which I now painfully relish from our last encounter.
<br/>

You never kept mute when you saw good or bad, commending and admonishing where necessary. You always praised my mum Nneokwukwe Beatrice Offu for raising daughters of good repute and allowing them to be a blessing to your family.
<br/>

Your encouragement and love during difficult times were greatly felt by everyone in all social standings more so by your siblings and my husband your brother.
<br/>

Your fear of God was without question and it showed in how you were uncompromising in situations and treated everyone with the same level of respect and dignity.
<br/>

“Nnenna Nwuyem” and the passion with which that name was called will always remain with me.
<br/>

I cannot question God but be assured of my prayers for as He sustained you in life, He will undoubtedly give you peace in death.

<br/>
May the Blessed Virgin Mary your mother, intercede for you, AMEN.
<br/>

Adieu Ezeamaogaechi – Till we meet on the resurrection day.

<h2>A Tribute To My Dearest Brother</h2>
<p>
  My dear brother James, I feel a heavy pain in my heart when I remember
  that I will no longer see you again and have your wise counsel which you
  were ever ready to give without minding whether I like the advice or not
  because you always knew it's the best for me.
  <br />
  You exhibited a great courage and strength which only our father Patrick
  could equal and which encouraged us your younger ones to trudge on in
  life.
  <br />
  I cannot imagine an Otiji day meeting without you and your candid advice
  to us to be bold and courageous in life.
  <br />
  God, we cannot question you but we only pray that you give our brother
  James's soul eternal repose in your kingdom until we meet on the
  resurrection day to part no more.
  <br />
  Adieu, adieu our dearest Ezeamanogechi.

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO UNCLE JAMES OTIJI</h2>
      <p>
        Uncle, I feel so sad writing this tribute. I was hoping to see you again
        at the Otiji’s Day celebration to share our heartwarming conversations.
        <br />
        Ever since I lost my dad, you assumed the father figure in my life. You
        never missed the opportunity to encourage and affirm me whenever we
        meet.
        <br />
        I remember during one of my meetings with you, you told me how much of a
        son I mean to you. I left your presence that day filling fulfilled
        knowing that I have a father who believes in me.
        <br />
        Your demise has left a vacuum that no one can fill. Death is an
        inevitable end for everyone but I was not expecting to lose you now.
        <br />
        I will miss your presence and role in my life but grateful that my
        relationship with you was beyond being just a nephew.
        <br />
        You were a force to be reckoned with in Otiji’s family and everyone will
        miss your contribution in their lives.
        <br />
        Rest well my dearest uncle. You have indeed made your footprints on the
        sands of time and will be fondly remembered for all your good deeds.
        <br />
        May your gentle soul rest with God, amen.

        Even if we understand that it is a necessary part of life, we are never
        prepared to say goodbye for good. On this day, our hearts are heavy
        because we have lost a strong man who was very close to us. We are not
        only mourning your death, but we are also celebrating your
        accomplishments. I wish you a peaceful rest! Uncle.

      <h2>
        A Tribute to our Brother Chief, Engr. Aniesodo James Otiji
      </h2>
      <p>
        I write on behalf of the entire Umuada Otiji as we mourn the loss of our
        dear senior brother Engr. James. A.Otiji.
        <br>
        The news of our brother's demise came to us as a rude shock because he
        was present at the New Yam Festival held on 2nd September, 2023 in our
        home town by our lgwe, little did we know it is going to be the last
        time we will ever see our beloved Brother again.
        <br>
        The loss,no doubt is a very sad and irrepairable one but we are
        comforted in the knowledge that brother James has gone to be with the
        Lord and his memories will forever remain green in our hearts.
        <br>
        The Holy Bible states in the book of Ecclesiastics 3:1 that "there is a
        season and a time for every purpose under the heaven, a time to be born
        and a time to die " It was William Shakespeare who said "Thou know'st it
        is common all that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity ".
        <br>
        Death is inevitable, we cannot question God, because He giveth and He
        taketh. But our consolation is that our brother has ran a good race and
        gone the way of all mortals.
        <br>
        It is our prayer that the good legacy left by the Matriach during his
        life time will be sustained and that God Almighty will grant eternal
        rest to his soul.
        <br>
        Rest on Ezeamanaogaechi!

          we cannot.

          family at large forever, I am only left with your memories to live with
          now. No words can express my grief.
          <br>
          I pray that God will bring peace and solace to your family. You passed
          away because your body had served its purpose on earth .
          <br>
          Your soul had achieved what he came to do, learned what it came to
          learn, so you left a contented man.

  AN ICON OF WISDOM BOWS OUT
</h2>
        <p>

It is with a heart ladened with grief that we write this tribute in honour of an
extraordinary gentlemen, an embodiment of wisdom, an encyclopaedia of
knowledge, a lover of Progress, a great motivator, a wise teacher, and an intelligent
counsellor, Late ENGR. JAMES OTIJI (Ezeamanogechi).
<br>
Bro James, we feel great sorrow as we put down these few words of tribute in your
honour. 
<br>
Where do we begin to tell the story of a man whose kindness and love is
likened to that of the Good Samaritan in the scriptures?
<br>
Your death was so devastating as we painfully realize that we will no longer see, hear
nor feel that cheerful face, the sincere smiles, the loving heart, the meaningful gaze,
the encouraging words, the re-assuring presence, the beautiful accolades, the superb
support, and the strong manly disposition.
<br>
You are a kind, hardworking, loving, dynamic, caring, and an exceptional being with a
heart of gold. You hate to see people sad, mourn or cry. 
<br>
You will always find a way to
make everyone around you happy and comfortable with your funny but witty jokes.
Your ever charming smile warms the heart and brings one out of any looming or
prevailing downcast state. 
<br>
Your shoulder is always provided for people to lean on,
with a listening ear and soothing words while sharing in peoples’ life experiences.
<br>
Your wise counsels, moral and financial support to our family and others will always
be remembered. 
<br>
You are always joyful at any little positive achievement and can go
to any length to push the ladder of progress higher, to enviable heights. 
<br>
Your words of
wisdom and encouragements always stir up the urge to push into more exploits and
achieve greater successes. 
<br>
Your love, concern and care are next to none.
Your departure nonetheless has left a deep vacuum in OTIJI’s family.
<br>
Our consolation is that you lived a good life and touched all and sundry with his
passionate heart of love. 
<br>
We have no option than to hold on to the sweet memories
you had with us and the worthy legacies you left behind. 
<br>
By God’s grace, your
rewards await you in heaven.
<br>
We are grateful to the Almighty God for your long years of fruitful sojourn on earth
and the landmark indelible foot prints you made. 
<br>
Praying that He grant your gentle
soul eternal rest in heaven and bestow upon all Otiji family members the courage to
bear this irreparable loss, Amen.
<br>
Adieu Ezeamanogechi!
<br>
Continue to rest in the bosom of our Lord.

My Dear Uncle James,
<br>
You have been a reliable and constant presence all my life. Your solid and reassuring aura filled
and surrounded my childhood. We all felt that strong sense of security when you were around,
and I particularly remember that powerful booming voice that made us all feel confident and
invincible. Your loss is painful and has left an irreplaceable hole in my life. You were one person
I knew I could always rely on, and I expected you always to be there.
<br>
<br>
You were a great family man and a wonderful husband and father. You were a knowledgeable
and brilliant man who lit up the universe when you smiled, bringing so much vibrance and great
energy to your environment. You were a successful, hard-working, formidable, kind man who
commanded much respect. Your life, environment and your family&#39;s successes demonstrate
your commitment and innate genetic ability to turn everything around you into a success story.
You were a solid Catholic who substantially and positively impacted many lives.
<br>
<br>
We miss you dearly, Uncle James and pray that God gives us all the strength to deal with your
passing. You ran a fantastic race, uncle, and we will continue to love and admire you for all
eternity. Your solid contributions will echo through the ages.
<br>
<br>
May Almighty God grant your soul eternal peace in Heaven.
<br>
Adieu, Uncle James, until we meet again to part no more.
<br>
May your gentle soul rest in perfect
peace.

Your eternally grateful and loving nephew,
