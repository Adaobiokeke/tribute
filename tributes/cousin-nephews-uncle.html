      <h2>
        EULOGY FOR BROTHER JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI, OUR DEAR BELOVED BROTHER!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dear James Aniesodo Otiji, you who were the light of so many of our
        lives are being remembered on this solemn occasion as we feel your
        untimely loss.
        <br />
        I, and others in the Otiji family believe that your person, your
        so-human person, is no longer with us.
        <br />
        You who have always been there for the Otiji family far and wide, those
        of us who need help, advice, shoulders to cry on, hands to hold, ears to
        whisper our anguish to, and face to smile to and get a warm reception
        of, you will be all right my beloved.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this regard, I would be remiss if I did not mention that no amount of
        fancy writing words would convey the adequate honor you deserve.
        <br />
        It is never an easy task to grasp the inert, the depth of a great person
        in writing or in a speech. Words frequently fall short of capturing the
        true essence of a great one like you, Brother James.
        <br />
        My being about 7,000 miles away in the USA makes substantial emotions of
        my writing faint despite our over 60 years of relationship as blood
        brothers, friends, confidants, and fraternities.
        <br />
        In this instance, crying is almost infantile, and hopeless at best,
        because you can never come back to the family in body, but maybe in
        spirit.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I look into the abyss I can only fantasize about your silhouette, yet
        it is only a mirage in the figment of my imagination.
        <br />
        I visualize the faces of the Otiji members, and I can only see both
        smiles and tears. The tears, although there have been many tears of
        sadness since we lost you.
        <br />
        Those are not all tears of sadness, as we remember the good old times.
        The tears are the tears of joy, intermingled with nostalgic smiles, and
        good emotions, for the way you Brother James Otiji have left a permanent
        mark on our minds, hearts, and souls.
        <br />
        I can see in my mind's eyes; that each member of the family remembers
        some good encounters they had with you in your lifetime.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brother James, I can remember your childhood friends such as Michael
        Ozoalor, Mr. Nwachukwu, and Clement Aguweshi, whom I ran into at my
        school, the University of Perugia, in Perugia, Italy.
        <br />
        The first thing he said to me was how is your brother James doing,
        despite that I have not seen you for over ten years. Those of your
        friends all over the world would have their own private memories of you
        as a kind, fun-loving, and gentle soul.
        <br />
        You are a humble person who when you completed your engineering
        education in the USA, gathered your languages, and returned to Nigeria
        to work to help to improve Nigeria. The inert love in you has no
        boundary, nor limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        My brother James A. Otiji, me, and the Otiji family have the most
        treasured memories of you, your love, empathy, sympathy, and sense of
        unflinching dedication to ensuring unity in our family.
        <br />
        I do know that somewhere, in the vastness of whatever lies beyond,
        Brother James A. Otiji you are smiling down at us and wishing us well.
        <br />
        I, and all of the Otiji family love you. Brother James Otiji, go well,
        rest in peace with the Lord's blessings until we meet again in heaven.
        <br />

      <p>
        My dear brother James, I feel a heavy pain in my heart when I remember
        that I will no longer see you again and have your wise counsel which you
        were ever ready to give without minding whether I like the advice or not
        because you always knew it's the best for me.
        <br />
        You exhibited a great courage and strength which only our father Patrick
        could equal and which encouraged us your younger ones to trudge on in
        life.
        <br />
        I cannot imagine an Otiji day meeting without you and your candid advice
        to us to be bold and courageous in life.
        <br />
        God, we cannot question you but we only pray that you give our brother
        James's soul eternal repose in your kingdom until we meet on the
        resurrection day to part no more.
        <br />
        Adieu, adieu our dearest Ezeamanogechi.
        <br />

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO UNCLE JAMES OTIJI</h2>
      <p>
        Uncle, I feel so sad writing this tribute. I was hoping to see you again
        at the Otiji’s Day celebration to share our heartwarming conversations.
        <br />
        Ever since I lost my dad, you assumed the father figure in my life. You
        never missed the opportunity to encourage and affirm me whenever we
        meet.
        <br />
        I remember during one of my meetings with you, you told me how much of a
        son I mean to you. I left your presence that day filling fulfilled
        knowing that I have a father who believes in me.
        <br />
        Your demise has left a vacuum that no one can fill. Death is an
        inevitable end for everyone but I was not expecting to lose you now.
        <br />
        I will miss your presence and role in my life but grateful that my
        relationship with you was beyond being just a nephew.
        <br />
        You were a force to be reckoned with in Otiji’s family and everyone will
        miss your contribution in their lives.
        <br />
        Rest well my dearest uncle. You have indeed made your footprints on the
        sands of time and will be fondly remembered for all your good deeds.
        <br />
        May your gentle soul rest with God, amen.
        <br />

        because we have lost a strong man who was very close to us. We are not
        only mourning your death, but we are also celebrating your
        accomplishments. I wish you a peaceful rest! Uncle.

        I write on behalf of the entire Umuada Otiji as we mourn the loss of our
        dear senior brother Engr. James. A.Otiji.
        <br>
        The news of our brother's demise came to us as a rude shock because he
        was present at the New Yam Festival held on 2nd September, 2023 in our
        home town by our lgwe, little did we know it is going to be the last
        time we will ever see our beloved Brother again.
        <br>
        The loss,no doubt is a very sad and irrepairable one but we are
        comforted in the knowledge that brother James has gone to be with the
        Lord and his memories will forever remain green in our hearts.
        <br>
        The Holy Bible states in the book of Ecclesiastics 3:1 that "there is a
        season and a time for every purpose under the heaven, a time to be born
        and a time to die " It was William Shakespeare who said "Thou know'st it
        is common all that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity ".
        <br>
        Death is inevitable, we cannot question God, because He giveth and He
        taketh. But our consolation is that our brother has ran a good race and
        gone the way of all mortals.
        <br>
        It is our prayer that the good legacy left by the Matriach during his
        life time will be sustained and that God Almighty will grant eternal
        rest to his soul.
        <br>
        Rest on Ezeamanaogaechi!
        <br>
        Rest on our Orator
        <br>
        Rest on Brother

        <br>
        A self made man who grew to care more for other people's problems than
        his private needs Death what gave thee the brevity to intercept to the

        are lamenting, women are wailing, and children, are weeping .

        Death is inevitable, it is a journey that everyone must take. Often
        times we wish death wasn’t a part of life, we wish we would just stay
        alive on earth with our near and dear ones not dying. But unfortunately,
        we cannot.
        <br>
        Our prayer is that we fulfill our days on earth and grow old before our
        time is up. Uncle, Engr Aniesodo James Otiji ( Eze-amana-ogaechi ) you
        are gone, but you will never be forgotten.
        <br>
        We may be apart, but your memory will live within me and member of Otiji
        family at large forever, I am only left with your memories to live with
        now. No words can express my grief.
        <br>
        I pray that God will bring peace and solace to your family. You passed
        away because your body had served its purpose on earth .
        <br>
        Your soul had achieved what he came to do, learned what it came to
        learn, so you left a contented man.
        <br>
        Rest in peace, uncle.
