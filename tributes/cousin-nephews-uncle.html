      <h2>
        EULOGY FOR BROTHER JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI, OUR DEAR BELOVED BROTHER!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dear James Aniesodo Otiji, you who were the light of so many of our
        lives are being remembered on this solemn occasion as we feel your
        untimely loss.
        <br />
        I, and others in the Otiji family believe that your person, your
        so-human person, is no longer with us.
        <br />
        You who have always been there for the Otiji family far and wide, those
        of us who need help, advice, shoulders to cry on, hands to hold, ears to
        whisper our anguish to, and face to smile to and get a warm reception
        of, you will be all right my beloved.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this regard, I would be remiss if I did not mention that no amount of
        fancy writing words would convey the adequate honor you deserve.
        <br />
        It is never an easy task to grasp the inert, the depth of a great person
        in writing or in a speech. Words frequently fall short of capturing the
        true essence of a great one like you, Brother James.
        <br />
        My being about 7,000 miles away in the USA makes substantial emotions of
        my writing faint despite our over 60 years of relationship as blood
        brothers, friends, confidants, and fraternities.
        <br />
        In this instance, crying is almost infantile, and hopeless at best,
        because you can never come back to the family in body, but maybe in
        spirit.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I look into the abyss I can only fantasize about your silhouette, yet
        it is only a mirage in the figment of my imagination.
        <br />
        I visualize the faces of the Otiji members, and I can only see both
        smiles and tears. The tears, although there have been many tears of
        sadness since we lost you.
        <br />
        Those are not all tears of sadness, as we remember the good old times.
        The tears are the tears of joy, intermingled with nostalgic smiles, and
        good emotions, for the way you Brother James Otiji have left a permanent
        mark on our minds, hearts, and souls.
        <br />
        I can see in my mind's eyes; that each member of the family remembers
        some good encounters they had with you in your lifetime.
        <br>
        <br>
        Brother James, I can remember your childhood friends such as Michael
        Ozoalor, Mr. Nwachukwu, and Clement Aguweshi, whom I ran into at my
        school, the University of Perugia, in Perugia, Italy.
        <br />
        The first thing he said to me was how is your brother James doing,
        despite that I have not seen you for over ten years. Those of your
        friends all over the world would have their own private memories of you
        as a kind, fun-loving, and gentle soul.
        <br />
        You are a humble person who when you completed your engineering
        education in the USA, gathered your languages, and returned to Nigeria
        to work to help to improve Nigeria.
        The inert love in you has no boundary, nor limitations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My brother James
        A. Otiji, me, and the Otiji family have the most treasured memories of
        you, your love, empathy, sympathy, and sense of unflinching dedication
        to ensuring unity in our family.
        <br />
        I do know that somewhere, in the vastness of whatever lies beyond,
        Brother James A. Otiji you are smiling down at us and wishing us well.
        <br />
        I, and all of the Otiji family love you. Brother James Otiji, go well,
        rest in peace with the Lord's blessings until we meet again in heaven.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dr. Sylvester N. Otiji & Family

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO UNCLE JAMES OTIJI</h2>
      <p>
        Uncle, I feel so sad writing this tribute. I was hoping to see you again
        at the Otiji’s Day celebration to share our heartwarming conversations.
        <br />
        Ever since I lost my dad, you assumed the father figure in my life. You
        never missed the opportunity to encourage and affirm me whenever we
        meet.
        <br />
        I remember during one of my meetings with you, you told me how much of a
        son I mean to you. I left your presence that day filling fulfilled
        knowing that I have a father who believes in me.
        <br />
        Your demise has left a vacuum that no one can fill. Death is an
        inevitable end for everyone but I was not expecting to lose you now.
        <br />
        I will miss your presence and role in my life but grateful that my
        relationship with you was beyond being just a nephew.
        <br />
        You were a force to be reckoned with in Otiji’s family and everyone will
        miss your contribution in their lives.
        <br />
        Rest well my dearest uncle. You have indeed made your footprints on the
        sands of time and will be fondly remembered for all your good deeds.
        <br />
        May your gentle soul rest with God, amen.
        <br />
        <br />
        From your Nephew
        <br />
        Tochukwu Otiji.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Even if we understand that it is a necessary part of life, we are never
        prepared to say goodbye for good. On this day, our hearts are heavy
        because we have lost a strong man who was very close to us. We are not
        only mourning your death, but we are also celebrating your
        accomplishments. I wish you a peaceful rest! Uncle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Otiji Onyeka
