      <h2>Dear Grandpa,</h2>
      <p>
        I love you so much. I miss you every day. 
        <br>
        You were the best grandpa in the
        world. I remember when we played together and you made me laugh so much,
        especially how you called me "Ada papa ooo " .
        <br>
        I loved the stories you
        told me before bed and the hugs you gave me. 
        <br>
        I'm sad that you're not here
        with us anymore, but I know you are in heaven watching over me. 
        <br>
        I will
        always love you, Grandpa. 
     </p>
