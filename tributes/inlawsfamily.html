      <!-- <h2>A TRIBUTE TO MY IN-LAW, CHIEF, ENGR. JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI</h2>
      <p>
        It's said that any good and responsible man can be a father even if you
        are not related to that person by blood and I totally agree with that,
        as my in-law lived in attestation to that.
        <br />
        The news of your demise came so shocking to us. Just barely three months
        ago I sat in discussion with you as one family, little did I know what
        fate has in store for us.
        <br />
        Yet, God is all knowing and we give him thanks in all situation.
        <br />
        Nna anyi, you were one in a million, with a heart of gold. your
        cheerful, caring, doting & benevolent nature is second to none.
        <br />
        Right from the time we came asking for your daughter's hand in marriage,
        you made everything easy for us. You never allowed my son to be troubled
        with anything.
        <br />
        The good legacies & positive values you inculcated into your family is
        worthy of celebration. A positive which remains a bane of our long and
        strong in-law relationship.
        <br />
        You were a devout christian and we are comforted knowing that your place
        is already assured besides our lord Jesus Christ in Heaven...
        <br />
        Until we meet to part no more, Continue to rest in the Bossom of the
        lord.
        <br />
        We miss you so much!!

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO MY IN-LAW ENGR.JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI</h2>
      <p>
        The news of your transition, came to me and the entire family leaving me
        completely devastated especially when it occurred to me that I would no
        longer see or hear from you on the phone as usual.
        <br />
        It however made me reflect that life is a transient gift from God and
        before you know it, it is all over.
        <br />
        Engr Aniesodo, you lived a fulfilled life worthy of emulation for us the
        living because you touched many lives both in your village and
        Umuabi-udi and the Country as a whole even after you left public Service
        as a Director.
        <br />
        Engr. we wish you well as you embark on this Journey of meeting your
        creator.
        <br />
        We pray he will have mercy on you and we Umuabi Indigines wish you a
        safe journey your Community will Miss you.
