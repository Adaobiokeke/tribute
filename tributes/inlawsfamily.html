        A TRIBUTE TO MY IN-LAW, CHIEF, ENGR. JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI
      </h2>
      <P>
        It's said that any good and responsible man can be a father even if you are not related to that person by blood and I totally agree with that, as my in-law lived in attestation to that. 
        <br>
        The news of your demise came so shocking to us. Just barely three months ago I sat in discussion with you as one family, little did I know what fate has in store for us. 
        <br>
        Yet, God is all knowing and we give him thanks in all situation. 
        <br>
Nna anyi, you were one in a million, with a heart of gold. your cheerful, caring, doting & benevolent nature is second to none.
<br>
Right from the time we came asking for your daughter's hand in marriage, you made everything easy for us. You never allowed my son to be troubled with anything. 
<br>
The good legacies & positive values you inculcated into your family is worthy of celebration. A positive which remains a bane of our long and strong in-law relationship. 
<br>
You were a devout christian and we are comforted knowing that your place is already assured besides our lord Jesus Christ in Heaven...
<br>
Until we meet to part no more, Continue to rest in the Bossom of the lord.
<br>
We miss you so much!!

    <h2>TRIBUTE TO MY IN-LAW ENGR.JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI</h2>
    <p>
      The news of your transition, came to me and the entire family leaving me
      completely devastated especially when it occurred to me that I would no
      longer see or hear from you on the phone as usual. 
      <br>
      It however made me reflect that life is a transient gift from God and before you know it, it
      is all over. 
      <br>
      Engr Aniesodo, you lived a fulfilled life worthy of emulation
      for us the living because you touched many lives both in your village and
      Umuabi-udi and the Country as a whole even after you left public Service
      as a Director. 
      <br>
      Engr. we wish you well as you embark on this Journey of
      meeting your creator.
      <br />
      We pray he will have mercy on you and we Umuabi
      Indigines wish you a safe journey your Community will Miss you.
