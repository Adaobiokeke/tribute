    <h2>TRIBUTE TO MY IN-LAW ENGR.JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI</h2>
    <p>
      The news of your transition, came to me and the entire family leaving me
      completely devastated especially when it occurred to me that I would no
      longer see or hear from you on the phone as usual. 
      <br>
      It however made me reflect that life is a transient gift from God and before you know it, it
      is all over. 
      <br>
      Engr Aniesodo, you lived a fulfilled life worthy of emulation
      for us the living because you touched many lives both in your village and
      Umuabi-udi and the Country as a whole even after you left public Service
      as a Director. 
      <br>
      Engr. we wish you well as you embark on this Journey of
      meeting your creator.
      <br />
      We pray he will have mercy on you and we Umuabi
      Indigines wish you a safe journey your Community will Miss you. 
      <br>
