      TRIBUTE TO MY FATHER IN-LAW LATE CHIEF ENGR. JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI
    </h2>
    <p>

September 19, 2023 was a sad day for me and my family because we lost a caring Father, Grand-Father and Father In-Law to a sudden death which we were never prepared for.
<br>
Though we are sad to see you go, we are also privileged to have shared our lives with you. 
<br>
You have always taught my wife and I how to always love each other, and work together. This lessons we will never forget.
<br>
You are also interested in my life endeavors, and has been a positive influence in most of the decisions I have made. I promise you that I will not disappoint you.
<br>
I saw how caring and loving you are to my dear wife and my kids, and I appreciate this a lot. 
<br>
Thank you. You have taught us so many things that we will pass onto generations to come. 
<br>
Your journey is an inspiration to my family and those whose lives you have touched. You will forever rest in our hearts. 
<br>
Rest on, Father in-Law,  until we meet to part no more.

    <h2>THANK YOU</h2>
    <p>
      “Thank you “…….Those were your last words to me. Those words also say a
      lot about our relationship.
       <br></br>
      As your daughter-in-law, you welcomed me into the family and showered me
      with so much love and kindness.
      <br></br>
     You always gave me a reason to say ‘THANKYOU’ . 
     <br></br>
     You were very supportive of me and at every point I needed
      guidance, you were a voice I could trust. 
      <br></br>
      You always said GOD gave you a special “mindset” and in truth, you had a way of birthing great ideas.
      <br></br>
      On your last birthday, you said to us that everything you have ever asked God
      for, he had given it to you, and even more. 
      <br></br>
      Daddy, you lived a fulfilled life and I am grateful to GOD. Thank you for being a great father-in-law.
      <br></br>
      You will be truly missed but I refuse to grieve like those without hope,
      but rather thank God for your resurrection and every beautiful year he
      gave you on earth.
