    <h2>THANK YOU</h2>
    <p>
      “Thank you “…….Those were your last words to me. Those words also say a
      lot about our relationship.
       <br></br>
      As your daughter-in-law, you welcomed me into the family and showered me
      with so much love and kindness.
      <br></br>
     You always gave me a reason to say ‘THANKYOU’ . 
     <br></br>
     You were very supportive of me and at every point I needed
      guidance, you were a voice I could trust. 
      <br></br>
      You always said GOD gave you a special “mindset” and in truth, you had a way of birthing great ideas.
      <br></br>
      On your last birthday, you said to us that everything you have ever asked God
      for, he had given it to you, and even more. 
      <br></br>
      Daddy, you lived a fulfilled life and I am grateful to GOD. Thank you for being a great father-in-law.
      <br></br>
      You will be truly missed but I refuse to grieve like those without hope,
      but rather thank God for your resurrection and every beautiful year he
      gave you on earth.
