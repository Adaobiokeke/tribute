        TRIBUTE TO MY LOVELY FRIEND CHIEF (ENGR.) JAMES ANIESODO OTIJI
      </h2>
      <p>

Ezeamanogechi, I give all Glory to God for your life. I also thank Him for making me your friend. You are really a friend indeed.
<br>
God blessed you with a Lovely wife and children closely knitted in one. You were an embodiment of love to your children and all you came in contact with. You demonstrated what friendship means and stayed away from enmity.
<br>
You are a teacher to teachers and a philosopher. A messenger of consolation in difficult times. A symbol of development. A man that is transparent, honest and outspoken in matter of truth. 
<br>
A man with heart of gold. A man of Benevolence, patriotism, selflessness and a philanthropist.

It's been said,that for a man to live a successful life, he must thrive and balance almost all aspects of life. 
<br>
Ezeamanogechi, you were such a man. Your lifestyle, social, family etc. all blossomed. Though you are gone, your legacy will not be forgotten. We love you and cherished your style, but God who has called at this time loves you most.
<br>
Adieu Ezeamanogechi
<br>
Adieu Otigwogwo
<br>
Adieu Aniesodo
<br>
Rest in Peace.
<br>
<br>

  Chief Engr. Sir Jonathan O. Iyiegbu (JP) (Nnewulu Oba)

  Proudly your friend but brother.

      <h2>TRIBUTE OF ENGR J.A. OTIJI (late)</h2>
      <p>
        Engr. James Aniesodo Otiji was a man I thank my God for ever meeting.
        <br >

        Fate brought us together in 1987 during the general posting of 1986/1987
        in the Fed Min. of works. Ibadan.
        <br >
        Within 3 months we were both posted to Osogbo office. Remember, Osogbo
        was then in Oyo state.
        <br >
        A short while after, we were moved again to Iseyin office where we spent
        many years together. Being a family man by then, his family joined him
        at Iseyin.
        <br >
        When temporary separation came between us, he was posted to
        Achi-Fugar-Agenebode road project. While there, he invited me for a
        visit, just as he did when he was Works Controller in Zamfara state.
        <br >
        <br>
        His love for me did not stop there: out of the four journeys I ever made
        to the East, three were at his instance. He made me to know many of his
        relations at both Enugu and village - Aguobu Umuoba in Ezeagu Local Govt
        of Enugu State.
        <br >
        Infact, I remember we visited his late mother on her sick bed before she
        finally passed on.
        <br >
        Another incident was when he decided to finally relocate his family back
        to the East, he saw no one he could give the responsibility of driving
        his family back to Enugu from Ibadan, than me, which I happily obliged.
        <br >
        He was not just a boss but a friend; and the friendship extended to our
        wives and children. In fact, God used this great man to save my marriage
        at a point.
        <br >
        <br>
        Many times, some of our staff in Ibadan would have to approach him
        through me because of our closeness. He was a large hearted and
        forgiving man. I remember an incident while out together, a car rammed
        into his own from the rear;
        after seeing the heavy damage to both cars, and the culprit on all fours
        begging, could one believe that he dug his hand into his pocket and gave
        some money to the man to repair his car, not minding his own badly
        damaged car!
        When I asked him why, he said 'Judging from the man's car, he must be a
        poor man' ... that is Otigwogwo for you.
        <br >
        <br>
        His anger always lasted only for a little while, followed with total
        forgiveness or even some assistance in addition, atimes.
        <br >
        He was an Ahitophel, a wonderful counselor. Many of his colleagues used
        to seek his opinion on various issues; you rejected his counsel to your
        peril. God endowed him with wisdom so much above his peers.
        <br >
        I received a tangible parting gift from him when he finally left Ibadan.
        That day he said,'Bode, take this'; I asked, 'For what?' 'We will talk
        later' was his reply. Since I know him very well, I knew it was for
        keeps.
        <br >
        <br>
        Adieu, a Great Boss and Friend.
        <br >
        Adieu, husband of Oby-Girl, the pet name he used to call his wife,
        <br >
        Adieu, father of Nnamdi, Ada-'Daddy' and Junior 'JJ' till we part no
        more.

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO A DEPARTED FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE.</h2>
      <p>
        'Oti gwom gwom'!
        <br >
        This was how we, your friends and colleagues, used to call you because
        you were always full of life.
        <br >
        I still remember vividly the beautiful times we had while working in
        Federal Ministry of Works, Headquarters, Road Construction and
        Rehabilitation Division ( south- west), Abuja.
        <br >
        This was prior to our meritorious retirement from service. 'Oti gwom
        gwom', my heart bleeds as I drop this short Tribute.
        <br >
        It is, indeed, very hard to believe that you are no more: a man full of
        life and kindness, an accomplished Civil Engineer, an excellent
        colleague and friend, a respected and responsible gentleman, a loving
        and doting husband to his wife, children and all.
        <br >
        You have fulfilled your purpose in life and on earh and we will always
        share your stories and cherish them.
        <br >
        We miss you so much but God loves you more. May your beautiful soul rest
        with the Lord in perfect peace until we meet again to part no more.
        <br >
        ADIEU!!

        A Tribute To A Dear Friend
      </h2>
      <p>
        We received with great shock the death of your beloved husband, father,
        grandfather, and our friend Engr.
        <br >
        James A. Otiji. During our interactions with him, we were graced with
        his warmth and sense of humour. He radiated love, peace, and positively
        affected the lives of those who encountered him.
        <br >
        Oby, I feel very much for you, cognizant of the wonderful partnership
        you both had as husband and wife.
        <br >
        We will miss his jokes and infectious smile, but we will all be consoled
        because he lived a fulfilled life and did not go through the pains of a
        protracted illness which was always his prayer.
        <br >
        During this trying moment, we pray for God's love, strength and
        protection. We also pray to God to give the entire Otiji family the
        fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
        <br >
        We join you in prayer that God will grant his kind and peaceful soul
        eternal rest. Amen.
        <br >
        Accept our Condolences.
