      <h2>TRIBUTE TO A DEPARTED FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE.</h2>
      <p>
        'Oti gwom gwom'!
        <br />
        This was how we, your friends and colleagues, used to call you because
        you were always full of life.
        <br />
        I still remember vividly the beautiful times we had while working in
        Federal Ministry of Works, Headquarters, Road Construction and
        Rehabilitation Division ( south- west), Abuja.
        <br />
        This was prior to our meritorious retirement from service. 'Oti gwom
        gwom', my heart bleeds as I drop this short Tribute.
        <br />
        It is, indeed, very hard to believe that you are no more: a man full of
        life and kindness, an accomplished Civil Engineer, an excellent
        colleague and friend, a respected and responsible gentleman, a loving
        and doting husband to his wife, children and all.
        <br />
        You have fulfilled your purpose in life and on earh and we will always
        share your stories and cherish them.
        <br />
        We miss you so much but God loves you more. May your beautiful soul rest
        with the Lord in perfect peace until we meet again to part no more.
        <br />
        ADIEU!!
        <br />
        <br />
        Sir ( Engr.) Felix Nnamdi Nwokedi (KSJI).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We received with great shock the death of your beloved husband, father,
        grandfather, and our friend Engr.
        <br />
        James A. Otiji. During our interactions with him, we were graced with
        his warmth and sense of humour. He radiated love, peace, and positively
        affected the lives of those who encountered him.
        <br />
        Oby, I feel very much for you, cognizant of the wonderful partnership
        you both had as husband and wife.
        <br />
        We will miss his jokes and infectious smile, but we will all be consoled
        because he lived a fulfilled life and did not go through the pains of a
        protracted illness which was always his prayer.
        <br />
        During this trying moment, we pray for God's love, strength and
        protection. We also pray to God to give the entire Otiji family the
        fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
        <br />
        We join you in prayer that God will grant his kind and peaceful soul
        eternal rest. Amen.
        <br />
        Accept our Condolences.
        <br />
        <br />

      <h2>TRIBUTE TO A GREAT MAN</h2>
      <p>
        Indeed a great iroko tree has fallen !
        <br />
        A great lion has been trapped!!
        <br />
        A rare gem and a hero is gone !!!
        <br />
        A man of the people an active and peaceful man, full of wisdom ,
        nobility, humility, gentility , simplicity and a philanthropist full of
        philosophical saying , all worthy of emulation, would be perceived no
        more. Death thou art inevitable indeed .
        <br />
        You sneaked in and snatched away my great uncle Eng JAMSE OTIJI EZE
        AMANA OGAECHI the iroko tree that stood unique amidst the forest. the
        hand that fed thousand of mouths .
        <br />
        A self made man who grew to care more for other people's problems than
        his private needs Death what gave thee the brevity to intercept to the
        joyous mood of our kit and kin and substitute it with mood emotions? Men
        are lamenting, women are wailing, and children, are weeping .
        <br />
        Our family has lost a rare gem , for the legacy bequeathed by eze Amana
        OGAECHI may be extra difficult to acquire . Great uncle remain in GODs
        own bosom.
        <br />
        Adieu pa James ! Adieu ikenga!! Adieu eze Amana
        <br />
        OGAECHI Eng CHIDERA .FT NNABUIFE
        <br />
        For MIS perpetual family
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Death is inevitable, it is a journey that everyone must take. Often
        times we wish death wasnâ€™t a part of life, we wish we would just stay
        alive on earth with our near and dear ones not dying. But unfortunately,
        we cannot.
        <br>
        Our prayer is that we fulfill our days on earth and grow old before our
        time is up. Uncle, Engr Aniesodo James Otiji ( Eze-amana-ogaechi ) you
        are gone, but you will never be forgotten.
        <br>
        We may be apart, but your memory will live within me and member of Otiji
        family at large forever, I am only left with your memories to live with
        now. No words can express my grief.
        <br>
        I pray that God will bring peace and solace to your family. You passed
        away because your body had served its purpose on earth .
        <br>
        Your soul had achieved what he came to do, learned what it came to
        learn, so you left a contented man.
        <br>
        Rest in peace, uncle.
