      <h2>TRIBUTE TO A DEPARTED FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE.</h2>
      <p>
        'Oti gwom gwom'!
        <br>
        This was how we, your friends and colleagues, used to call you because
        you were always full of life.
        <br>
        I still remember vividly the beautiful times we had while working in
        Federal Ministry of Works, Headquarters, Road Construction and
        Rehabilitation Division ( south- west), Abuja.
        <br>
        This was prior to our meritorious retirement from service. 'Oti gwom
        gwom', my heart bleeds as I drop this short Tribute.
        <br>
        It is, indeed, very hard to believe that you are no more: a man full of
        life and kindness, an accomplished Civil Engineer, an excellent
        colleague and friend, a respected and responsible gentleman, a loving
        and doting husband to his wife, children and all.
        <br>
        You have fulfilled your purpose in life and on earh and we will always
        share your stories and cherish them.
        <br>
        We miss you so much but God loves you more. May your beautiful soul rest
        with the Lord in perfect peace until we meet again to part no more.
        <br>
        ADIEU!!
        <br>

      <p>
        We received with great shock the death of your beloved husband, father,
        grandfather, and our friend Engr.
        <br>
        James A. Otiji. During our interactions with him, we were graced with
        his warmth and sense of humour. He radiated love, peace, and positively
        affected the lives of those who encountered him.
        <br>
        Oby, I feel very much for you, cognizant of the wonderful partnership
        you both had as husband and wife.
        <br>
        We will miss his jokes and infectious smile, but we will all be consoled
        because he lived a fulfilled life and did not go through the pains of a
        protracted illness which was always his prayer.
        <br>
        During this trying moment, we pray for God's love, strength and
        protection. We also pray to God to give the entire Otiji family the
        fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
        <br>
        We join you in prayer that God will grant his kind and peaceful soul
        eternal rest. Amen.
        <br>
        Accept our Condolences.
        <br>
