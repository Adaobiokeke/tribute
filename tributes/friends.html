    <h2>TRIBUTE TO A DEPARTED FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE.</h2>
    <p>
      'Oti gwom gwom'!
      <br />
      This was how we, your friends and colleagues, used to call you because you
      were always full of life.
      <br />
      I still remember vividly the beautiful times we had while working in
      Federal Ministry of Works, Headquarters, Road Construction and
      Rehabilitation Division ( south- west), Abuja.
      <br />
      This was prior to our meritorious retirement from service. 'Oti gwom
      gwom', my heart bleeds as I drop this short Tribute.
      <br />
      It is, indeed, very hard to believe that you are no more: a man full of
      life and kindness, an accomplished Civil Engineer, an excellent colleague
      and friend, a respected and responsible gentleman, a loving and doting
      husband to his wife, children and all.
      <br />
      You have fulfilled your purpose in life and on earh and we will always
      share your stories and cherish them.
      <br />
      We miss you so much but God loves you more. May your beautiful soul rest
      with the Lord in perfect peace until we meet again to part no more.
      <br />
      ADIEU!! 
      <br>
      <br>
      Sir ( Engr.) Felix Nnamdi Nwokedi (KSJI).
