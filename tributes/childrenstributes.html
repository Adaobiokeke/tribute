      <h2>Tribute to my Father</h2>
      <p>
        In loving memory of my late father, Chief Engineer James Aniesodo Otiji,
        I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for shaping me into the person
        I am today. My father was not just a parent, he was a true superhero who
        instilled in me the values of perseverance and aiming high, because as
        he always said, low aim is a crime.
        <br></br>
        One of the things that always brings a smile to my face is how my father
        lovingly called me "Jim boy." It was his special nickname for me, a
        symbol of the strong bond we shared. He had unwavering faith in me and
        believed that I had the strength to defend and protect our entire family
        whenever necessary. It was this belief in me that motivated me to become
        the best version of myself.
       <br></br>
        Now, I must confess, I was quite the mischievous one in our family. Yet,
        my father's love for me knew no bounds. He did everything in his power
        to transform me from the naughty troublemaker into a source of pride for
        our family. His patience and guidance shaped my character and taught me
        valuable life lessons. Despite my antics, his love and support never
        wavered.
       <br></br>
        We had countless precious moments together, filled with laughter,
        stories, and cherished conversations. Little did we know that our time
        together would be cut short. My father had once spoken about a future
        without him, a day I never wanted to face. But alas, it arrived too
        soon. His words of wisdom and his vision for my future still echo in my
        heart, driving me to fulfill his last wish for me â€“ to make him proud.
       <br></br>
        There was something truly remarkable about my father. He had a love that
        embraced everyone and a heart that radiated hope. Just spending a mere
        five minutes with him was enchanting, for his presence exuded warmth,
        wisdom, and guidance. I can only aspire to absorb even a fraction of his
        extraordinary qualities.
       <br></br>
        As a protector, my father never faltered. From Ibadan to Osogbo, Iseyin
        to Zamfara, Funtua to Abuja, he ensured our safety and provided for all
        our needs. His dedication sheltered us from the uncertainties of life.
        Thanks to his tireless efforts, I have never been a tenant throughout my
        life. This man, my father, is not just my hero; he is a legend whose
        impact will forever endure.
       <br></br>
        Dear Dad, as I bid you farewell, please know that your memory will
        forever reside within my heart. Your presence continues to inspire me,
        urging me to be the best version of myself every single day. As I strive
        to make you proud, I promise to carry forth your legacy with honor,
        determination, and an unwavering spirit. Rest in perfect peace, my
        beloved father. Your absence will be deeply felt, but your love will
        forever guide my steps.
        <br></br>
