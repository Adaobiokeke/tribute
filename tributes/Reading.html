      <h3>Entrance antiphon</h3>
      <p>
        Just as Jesus died and rose again so will the Father bring with Him
        those who have died in Jesus.

        <br />
        Just in Adam all men died, so in Christ all will be made alive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>OPENING PRAYER</h3>
      <p>
        O God, to whom it belongs to have mercy and to spare, we humbly entreat
        you for the soul of your son LATE ANIESODO JAMES OTIJI, whom you have
        summoned from this world, that you would deliver him from the hands of
        the enemy and not forget him forever, but bid your Holy Angels to
        receive him and lead him to your home in paradise. 
        <br>
        Since he has placed
        all his hope in you, may he not know the pains of hell but bring him
        eternal happiness in heaven, through Christ our Lord Jesus your son who
        lives and reigns with you and the unity of the Holy Spirit world without
        end, Amen.
      </p>

      <h3>FIRST READING</h3>
      <h3>A Reading from the Book of Wisdom(3:1-9)</h3>
      <p>
        Brethren, the souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God, no torment
        shall ever touch them. In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear die,
        their going looked like a disaster, their leaving us, like annihilation;
        but they are in peace. 
        <br>
        If they experience punishment as men see it,
        their hope was rich with immortality; light was their affliction, great
        will blessing be. God has put them to test and proved them worthy to be
        with Him. He has tested them like gold in a furnace, and accepted them
        as holocaust. When the time comes for His visitation, they will shine
        out: as sparks run through the stubble, so will they. 
        <br>
        They shall judge
        nations, rule over peoples, and the Lord will be their King forever.
        They who trust in Him will understand the truth, those who are faithful
        will live with Him in love, for grace and mercy wait those He has
        chosen.
      </p>

        1. The Lord is my shepherd. There is nothing I shall want, Fresh and

      <h3>Gospel</h3>
      <h3>A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew(5:1-12)</h3>
      <p>
        When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat
        down. His disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught
        them, saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for there is the kingdom
        of heaven. 
        <br>
        Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
        Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those
        who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
        <br>
        Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. Blessed are the
        pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peace-makers, for
        they will be called children of God. 
        <br>
        Blessed are those who are
        persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
        <br>
        Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all
        kinds of evil against you falsely on my account, Rejoice and be glad,
        for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted
        the prophets who were before you.
        <br />
        V: The Gospel of the Lord
        <br />
        R: Praise to you Lord Jesus Christ.
