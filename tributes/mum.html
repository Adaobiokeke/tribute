      <h2>A TRIBUTE TO AN ICON</h2>
      <h3>GOOD NIGHT TO MY HUSBAND</h3>
      <p>

        My Jim, so sad to come to terms with the fact that you left your beloved
        children and I without a father and a husband. 
        <br>
        The entire episode at the
        hospital seemed so unreal. I had never imagined seeing you go, the
        recurring decimal remain "could this be real? Does it mean the roaring of
        the Lion will henceforth seize? 
        <br>
        Jim could you have gone with all those
        endowment from above just like that? What a puzzle. Your friend Engr.
        Akinbode Akinluyi often called you The Ahitophel of our time because your
        wisdom, knowledge and experiences Were unmatchable, you had answers to all
        questions but death.
        <br>
        The vacuum is already so glaring, we can only find
        solace in the noble and enduring legacies you left on the sands of time in
        many fields-- Your career, a responsible family man and by your Great
        impact of your life in your environment. 
        <br>
        Lastly, though we can no
        longer enjoy your physical presence in our midst but the ideals for which
        you lived like a diamond will remain forever. 
        <br>
        Remarkably, I personally
        take solace in Knowing that you gave your life to Jesus Christ before your
        demise. 
        <br>
        Fare well My hearthrob 
        <br>
        <br>
