      <h2>
        A FAREWELL TO MY HUSBAND AND MY FRIEND
      </h2>
      <p>
        Jim dear, it's so sad to come to terms with the fact that you left your
        beloved children and I without a father and a husband. The entire
        episode at the hospital seemed so unreal, I had never imagined seeing
        you go. 
        <br>
        The recurring decimal remains "could this be true? Does this
        mean the roaring of the Lion will, henceforth, cease? Could He have gone
        with all those endowments? (Still a puzzle). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our 42years relationship
        left me with no regrets. You fulfilled every of your wedding vows, made
        sure I got the best of every good thing you could afford. You were so
        proactive on my affairs, complimented areas I lacked.
        <br>
        You took time to
        cultivate me, indeed you were the catalyst for my all-round growth, a
        huge personality with a heart of gold. 
        <br>
        I recall those early days of our
        relationship, you would cuddle our children while I was far at the other
        end of the country studying, you never derailed in your responsibility,
        we enjoyed your company much because you represented warmth and
        protection. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Your commitment to their studies, especially in mathematics
        showed up as they all turned to be mathematical geniuses. Your friends
        too are not left out, they are stunned and saddened by your demise
        knowing they will miss your unmatchable wisdom, knowledge, courage and
        oratory. 
        I had often heard your very close friend, Engr. Akinbode
        Akinluyi, call you severally "the Ahitophel of our time" because of your
        level of wisdom and decerning ability. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The vacuum in Otiji family and
        the entire Aguobu-Umumba community is already so glaring but we can only
        take solace in the noble and enduring legacies you left on the sands of
        time in your many fields----your career, a responsible family man and by
        the great impact of your life in your environment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, though we no
        longer enjoy your physical presence in our midst, the ideals for which
        you lived like a diamond will remain forever. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Remarkably, it is quite
        interesting to note that you lived long, lived well, richly and
        splendidly. 
        <br>
        Farewell Sweetheart I Miss you so dearly
      </p>
